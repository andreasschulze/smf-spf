Quick guide to installing smf-spf
=================================

Make sure you have the following RPMs installed:
1. sendmail    (your MTA)
2. sendmail-cf (needed to reconfigure sendmail)
3. libspf2     (library supporting smf-spf)
4. smf-spf     (the milter itself)

Configuring smf-spf
===================

The configuration file is /etc/mail/smfs/smf-spf.conf

Start the milter using `service smf-spf start'.

To ensure that the milter starts on every reboot, use `chkconfig smf-spf on'.

Configuring sendmail
====================

You need to tweak the sendmail.mc file in /etc/mail

If you are using sendmail 8.12.x compiled without -D_FFR_MILTER_PERDAEMON
(this is the case with the stock Red Hat/Fedora sendmails), then the SPF
checks will be done on all of your daemons, including the MSA daemon. This
shouldn't be a problem, but is a bit wasteful as message submission via
the MSA should always be authenticated, in which case no SPF checks need
be done at all.

Add the following to your sendmail.mc (before any MAILER lines):

define(`confMILTER_MACROS_HELO', confMILTER_MACROS_HELO`, {verify}')dnl
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`smf-spf', `S=unix:/run/smfs/smf-spf.sock, F=T, T=S:30s;R:1m')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp, Name=MTA')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=submission, Name=MSA, M=Ea')dnl

This gives you MTA and MSA (auth required, port 587) daemons, both using spfmilter.

If your version of sendmail is compiled with -D_FFR_MILTER_PERDAEMON or you
are using sendmail 8.13.x or later then you can limit the milter to run only
on the MTA daemon:

FEATURE(`no_default_msa')dnl
MAIL_FILTER(`smf-spf', `S=unix:/run/smfs/smf-spf.sock, F=T, T=S:30s;R:1m')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp, Name=MTA, InputMailFilters=smf-spf')dnl
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=submission, Name=MSA, M=Ea')dnl

Note: the `F=T,' part of the MAIL_FILTER causes incoming connections to be tempfailed (4xx)
if the milter is not available. If this parameter is omitted and the milter is unavailable,
sendmail will behave as if no filter is defined.

Having made these changes to sendmail.mc, use `make' to generate a new sendmail.cf.
Then use `service sendmail reload' to have sendmail use the new configuration and start
using smf-spf.
